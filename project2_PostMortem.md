# Project 2 - Post Mortem 


### What I will do differently next time? 

1.  To upgrade the user's authentication layer with passport.js. 

2.  To improve comment section of each recipe to have more functionality. 

3.  To implement search function to searh through recipes with keywords. 



### Approach that went well in this project that i would repeat next time?

1. Detailed planning of each steps. 
* came out with MVC file structures and summary of of all the routes, views and mongodb action. 
* wireframes - help me to expedite implementing of HTML and css. 
* user's authent


## code and code Design

### What is my code and program design in the project would i do differently next time? 

I've totally negleted the program design and jumped right away into coding. 
I should have spent some time on wireframing and understand the program by writing out a brief descrption of the program's purpose. Which involves understanding its inputs, processing and outputs. This might help me to visualize the program running on a computer. I can imagine what the monitor will look like, what the user must enter with the keyboard, and what processing or changes will be made. 
lastly, to use flowchart or pseudocode to document down the logic or algorithm of each function in my program. Understand the logic and planning the algorithm on paper before start to code. 



 ## Unit 1 Post Mortem 

In this whole journey of unit 1, i have  developed a habit of googling for resources and solutions. In event that I have lack of understanding of that particular topic. 
 
I have spent a big chuck of time to improve on my fundamental skills of Javascripts/  Hopefully, i will continue to maintain this habit. I personally feel that with stronger fundamental skill will save me a lot of time when come to doing actual coding of program. 

course materials and level are good.
