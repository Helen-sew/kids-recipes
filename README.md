## Project Title : Kid's Recipes App for Caring Mothers


## Project Demo
https://helen-sew.github ....
https://heroku

## Project motivation 
Many parents nowadays are busy working to make ends meet. They are too busy to plan and prepare healthly meals for thier kids. This app allows them to search for recipes and plan ahead. With this app, parents can share recipe with other parents by creating thier own recipe. They can update, delete and leave comments on each recipe to share tips to make meal planning easier for busy parents.  At the end, they can view all the recipes created by themselve from myRecipes page. 

## Technologies 
* Node.js, 
* Express
* EJS (use partials)
* TDD - Jest, Chai and Ajv
* User authentication - express-session, bcryt 
* MongoDB
* Bootstrap 
* CSS 

## Project scope and implementation : 

Step 1 : initial set-up of app 
* set up a project folder and run npm init -y and npm install all the dependencies like express, jest, chai, method-override, mongodb, mongo-seeding etc.
* touch server.js to require and use all the dependencies. 
* touch recipeSchema.js and set up schema validation for database at MongoDB compass. 
* touch index.js in db folder to connect database with MongoDB.

Step 2 - performce test driven development (TDD) at controller level 
* Touch recipeReposity.js and individual test.js files. Require jest and chai in individual test.js and write test cases for the 7 restful routes (i.e Index, Show, New, Create, Update, Edit, Delete routes).

Step 3 - Set up CRUD 

MVC chart here 

#### Home Route ('/')
* update appController.js - res.render home.ejs. 
* create home.ejs and add HTML and css.
* update routes.js.

#### Index Route ('/recipes')
* Update recipeController.js - create res.render  index.ejs  - to render all the recipes.
* create index.ejs and add HTML.
* In index.ejs, link each title to it's show page. 
* Update routes.js.  
* Add a link to the create new recipe. 

#### Show Route ('/recipes/:title')
* Update recipeController.js - create res.render show.ejs.
* Update routes.js. 
* Create a `show.ejs` and add HTML
  - show the title
  - show the img 
  - show the ingredients, directions, toServe and comments
* add a link back to the index page.


#### New Route ('/recipes/new')
* Update recipeController.js - create res.render new.ejs
* Update routes.js. 
* create new.ejs and it should contain a form with the following:
  - `form` with `action="/recipes"` and `method="POST"`
  - `input` type text for a `title`
  - `input` type text for a `img`
  - `input` type textarea for an `ingredients`
  - `input` type textarea for an `directions`
  - `input` type textarea for a `toServe`
  - `input` type textarea for a `comments`
  - `input` type submit

#### Create Route ('/recipes')
* Update recipeController.js. 
* npm install method-override and update server.js with:-
  - const methodOverride = require('method-override');
  - app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended:true }));
  - app.use(methodOverride('_method'));
* To `res.send` the `req.body` - it should send the data you inputted to your `new` form
* Redirect route to the show page after create. 


#### Edit Route ('/recipes/:title/edit)
* Update recipeController.js - create re-render edit.ejs.
* Update routes.js.
* In `show.ejs`, add a link to your edit route
* Create `edit.ejs` and it should contain a form with the following:
  - `form` with `action="/recipes/<%= item.title %>?_method=PUT" method="POST"`
  - `input` type text for a `title`
  - `input` type text for a `img`
  - `input` type textarea for an `ingredients`
  - `input` type textarea for an `directions`
  - `input` type textarea for a `toServe`
  - `input` type textarea for a `comments`
  - `input` type submit

#### Put Route ('/recipes/:title)
* Update recipeController.js.
* Update routes.js.
* upgrade ` edit.ejs` form to have the appropriate action and method
* create link to  `res.redirect` to index page


#### Delete Route ('/recipes/:title')
* Update recipeController.js.
* Update routes.js.
* In `show.ejs`, add a delete form with appropriate action and method:- 
  `action="/recipes/<%= item.title%>?_method=DELETE" method="POST"`.   
* make delete route redirect back to index page.

Step 4 Create user authentication layer

#### To define user schema and perform user schema validation test 
* create validator folder > create schema folder > touch users.js - define the user schema 
* Inside validator folder > touch usersValidator.js - install and use ajv, import user schema and write validation functions 
* Inside validator folder > create tests folder > touch usersValidator.spec.js - to install and use jest, chai, chai-asserttype, import usersValidator and write test cases 
* Update user schema in Mongodb Compass. 
* Inside db folder > update index.js to include users collection. 

#### performce test driven development (TDD) at controller level 
* Inside repositories folder > touch usersReposity.js - require db and bcrypt to write functions to create new user and retrive existing user when log in. 
* Inside repositories folder > tests folder > touch userCreate.test.js and touch usersFind.test.js to require chai, db and usersReposity.js and run test. 

#### For new user to sign up 
* Inside controller folder > touch usersController.js - require usersRepository.js and usersValidator.js. To validate req.body (input from user) and if pass validation, create new user and redirect user to home.page to log in. 
* Create signUpForm.ejs which include form with "action="/users" method="POST".
* Update routes.js to create post route and render signUpForm.ejs 

#### For existing user to log in 
* Update server.js - install express-session and require and use it in server.js.
* Inside controller foler > touch sessionsController.js - require usersReposity.js and bcrypt. To write functions to render log in form, find username and compare user's password and to destroy session (log out). 
* Create logInForm.ejs which include form with "action="/sessions" method="POST".
* Update routes.js to create post route and render logInForm.ejs. 

#### To design user authentication flow

Step 5 Heroku Deployment 




## Special Features 

#### myRecipe Page 
* myRecipe page allows user to view all the recipes created by them. This is like their own recipe book. They can edit,update and delete recipes as and when they like. 

#### Comment panel in each recipe page 
* allow users to add and delete comments.  Partially done. At the moment user still cannot delete comment. 


## Challenges 





  

* Full MVC file structure 
* Full CRUD - 7 restful routes 
* One Github commit per day
* Deploy online to Heroku 
* A README. Md file 
* Have a link to hosted working app in the README.md file in GitHub repo
* TDD - Test Cases for controllers
* Schema Validation - avj  (or can just do it MongoDB database/compass??)
* Sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorisation flow 
* Use Ejs partials
* Use css framework â€” bootstrap ??? 
* In README.md - include User story and wireframes.
